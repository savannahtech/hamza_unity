=> Integrated BitLabs SDK for offerWall according to requirements.

=> Made a Mini Dice Game to Visualize the task requirement that was to show offer panel on level 200.

=> This is a score based game so when user corsses 100 points there is popup thats say you need coins to unlock next gamepplay with a reward button next to it.

=> It shows offers available and user can chose from offer shown.
